Over the past 50 years, there have been numerous attempts to get the leaders of the three big political parties to debate with each other during an election. Tonight, history in the making, as we're joined by the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Nick Clegg, the Conservative party leader, David Cameron, and the leader of the Labour Party, Gordon Brown. This debate will mainly focus on domestic affairs, important issues that affect our everyday lives. If you want to make your own comments and follow the debate online, you can do so by going to ITV.com.

I think we have a fantastic opportunity to do things differently for once. If we do things differently, we can create the fair society, the fair country we all want: a fair tax system, better schools, an economy no longer held hostage by greedy bankers, decent, open politics. Those are the changes I believe in. I really wouldn't be standing here tonight if I didn't think they were all possible. So don't let anyone tell you that the only choice is old politics.

Now, every promise you hear from each of us this evening depends on one thing: a strong economy. And this is the defining year. Get the decisions right now, and we can have secure jobs, we can have standards of living rising, and we can have everybody better off. Get the decisions wrong now, and we could have a double-dip recession. And because we believe in fairness, as we cut the deficit, over these next few years, we will protect your police, your National Health Service, and we will protect your schools.

The expenses saga brought great shame on parliament. I'm extremely sorry for everything that happened. Your politicians, frankly all of us, let you down. Now, there is a big choice at this election: we can go on as we are, or we can say no, Britain can do much better; we can deal with our debts, we can get our economy growing and avoid this jobs tax, and we can build a bigger society. But we can only do this if we recognise we need join together, we need to come together, we need to recognise we're all in this together. Now, not everything Labour has done in the last 13 years has been wrong - they've done some good things and I would keep those, but we need change, and it's that change I want to help to lead. "

First, I introduced a points system so no unskilled worker from outside the European Union can come to Britain now. I also said that jobs had to be advertised in Jobcentres where there were skills that there were shortages of that we needed people in this country. I then said we're going to look at all the range of occupations where people come from abroad. I talked to a chef the other day who was training. I said in future, when we do it, there'll be no chefs allowed in from outside the European Union. Then I talked to some care assistants - no care assistants come in from outside the European Union. We are a tolerant, we are a diverse country, but the controls on migration that I'm introducing and I will see go further are the right controls, the right policy for Britain. "

        "Gerard, what I would say is that immigration is simply too high at the moment. It has been these last ten years, and it does need to come down. I think the pressures that we've put on housing and health and education have been too great. If you look at the...what's happening with immigration, the difference between the amount of people going to live overseas and those coming here, it's been often as high as 200,000. That's equivalent to two million across a decade. It's too much. I want us to bring immigration down so it is in the tens of thousands, not the hundreds of thousands. How would we do that? I think we need to have not just a points system, but also a limit on migration when people are coming from outside the European Union for economic reasons. I also think when new countries join the European Union, that actually we should have transitional controls so they can't all come here at once. It's been too high these last few years, and I would dearly love to get it down to the levels it was in the past so it is no longer an issue in our politics as it wasn't in the past. "

You have had lots and lots of tough talking about immigration from both Conservative and Labour governments, and complete chaos in the actual administration of the system. It was a Conservative government that removed the exit controls so we knew who was leaving as well as who was coming in. It's what the Labour government followed up on as well. What I think we need to do is, firstly, make sure we restore those exit controls, so we have borders so we know exactly who is coming in but also when they are supposed to leave. The second thing I would do is this. At the moment under the immigration system, if you want to come and work in this country, you have to show two things: firstly, that you've got a sponsor who is sponsoring your arrival in this country, and secondly, that there is a job for you to do. I want to add a third element: that you also only go to a place, to a region, where you are needed. So that we only send immigrants to those places where they can be coped.  "

It's falling as a result of the action we are taking and will continue to take. To stop illegal migration, which is what Nick has referred to, border controls have been brought in and we're counting people out and in from the end of this year. It was a policy the Conservatives scrapped before 1997. We've got ID cards now for foreign nationals so an employer can see whether they're legal or illegal. So we're taking precise and specific action. What I wouldn't do is have an arbitrary cap. An arbitrary cap means an employer... And I've been visiting a lot of employers in this region, who wants to bring someone in from abroad, needs that skilled worker, the skill is not here, cannot do that. Net inward migration will continue to fall under our policies. 40,000 less students, I suspect, this year, because of our tightening of visa controls. Now, these are the things practically we can do.

He said, \"I came here when I was six, I've served in the Royal Navy for 30 years. I'm incredibly proud of my country. But I'm so ashamed that we've had this out-of-control system with people abusing it so badly.\" If we don't address immigration properly, we're letting down immigrant communities, as well as everybody else. So we do need a cap. As well as border controls that Gordon talks about, and I support strong border controls, I think we need to go one step further and have a proper border police force so we combine at our borders, customs, immigration, security, and police, so we make the most of the fact that we do have policeable borders, and we can stop more illegal immigration that way as well.

I said to the ward sister \"What's going on? Why are there no babies being treated?\" She said \"New rules mean we can't employ any doctors from outside the European Union with the skills needed\". That's an example of where the rules are stopping good immigration which actually helps our public services to work properly. That's where I want to see, not an arbitrary cap. We can't just say a cap, what is it? 10, 10,000? A million? What if you reach the cap in the middle of summer and someone wants to come and play football for Manchester United or Manchester City?

Illegal immigrants are deterred because we've got ID cards for foreign nationals now, so an employer cannot say to someone \"You can come and have this job\". They've got to ask for the identity card first. There are big fines if employers break the law. Now, we've got to do more.

I went to Crosby the other day and I was talking to a woman there who had been burgled by someone who had just left prison. He stole everything in her house. As he left, he set fire to the sofa and her son died from the fumes. That burglar, that murderer, could be out of prison in just four-and-a-half years. The system doesn't work, but that sort of sentence is, I think, just completely unacceptable in terms of what the public expect for proper punishment. What have we got to do? We've got to get rid of the paperwork and the bureaucracy and we've got to get the police out on the streets.

This government wants to waste billions of your money on an ID card system so you have to pay for the privilege of having lots of your own details on a piece of plastic card that you carry around. For pretty well exactly the amount of money, your money, that the government is pouring into that, we could put 3,000 more police officers on the streets. That is the absolute priority for me. The second thing is this: there are too many young offenders who start first getting into trouble with low-level nuisance anti-social behaviour who become the hardened criminals of tomorrow. What we've got to do is stop the young offenders of today becoming the hardened criminals tomorrow. In my city of Sheffield, where I'm an MP, we've done some great things to do exactly that. That's the way to get burglary and crime down. "

And that's why there's three things I want to suggest this evening that will make people safer. One is we've got to have effective policing on the streets. Police have got to spend 80% of their time now on the streets. We've got record police numbers in this country, and we want to maintain that level of police force over the next few years. The second thing is, parents have got to accept responsibility for their children. If an order is passed against a teenager, then the parent has also got to accept responsibility, and we're bringing that in now. The third thing I would say is this: if you are dissatisfied with the way the police are treating or the police are dealing with your case, and you are persistently denied the rights you have, then we'll give you the right to take an injunction against the police so you can be sure that your rights against anti-social behaviour and crime are upheld.

I think we've got to be much faster at getting drug addicts off the streets and into treatment. And all too often, that doesn't happen. And even when it does today, they get put on a substitute drug. We're not really dealing with the problem, which is to get these people to confront their problems and lead drug-free lives. I even went to a drug rehab recently in my own constituency, and met a young man who told me that he committed a certain amount of crimes so he could get in front of a judge who could then get him a place in a residential rehab centre. We must be mad as a country not to get people into that residential rehab to get them to clean up their lives, so we cut the crime on our own streets. "

I think what makes me so angry is that again, it's like the immigration debate: so much tough talk from different governments of different parties for so long has turned our prisons into overcrowded colleges of crime. Do you know that young men going into prison now on short-term prison sentences now come out, and nine out of ten of them reoffend, so we are reproducing more crime than actually cutting it. What I've seen in my city of Sheffield is that you get these youngsters not when they've done serious crimes, but when they're first starting to get into trouble, to face their victims, explain why they've done what they've done to their victims, apologise for what they've done, make up for what they've done in the community, cleaning up parks and streets.

But the one thing I'm absolutely sure of - we've got to maintain the numbers of police we have in this country. We've built up the police force from a period when it was understaffed to a period where they now have more police than ever before. I want to make sure that that continues with neighbourhood policing accountable to you, with you able to direct what happens in your own local police force. If a police force is not performing well, let it be taken over by another police force, so the job is done properly for you. So I would not support those, and I'm afraid the Conservatives are not prepared to guarantee, as we are repared to do, that we will continue to fund the police force and the spending on police will continue to rise so that we have enough police there on the beat for you.

I think that's what Jacqueline is talking about, this desperate, hopeless feeling. It keeps happening over and over again. I met a young man in London the other day. His flat had been burgled five times, and one of them, would you believe it, Jacqueline, was when he was away at his father's funeral. He said to me \"Why can't this stop?\" Unless we do something different, not the same old remedies, but do something different to stop the youngsters today who are getting into trouble from becoming the hardened criminals of tomorrow, I don't this stuff will make the difference that they say it will.

I know how angry people are in this country. They pay their taxes and they don't pay their taxes for MPs to abuse the system. I know how angry I was when I heard about the moats and the duck houses and the rest of it. I was determined to do my bit to clean it up, to get my MPs to apologise, to get them to pay back money, all of which they did before the official reviews started to happen. But do you know one thing I think we really need to do as part of the apology, is to say to the British people, we're going to cut the cost of politics. We're going to cut the size of the House of Commons by 10%. We're going to cut ministers' pay by 5% and freeze it for the whole of the parliament. We're going to cut the size of Whitehall by a third. We're going to get rid of some of these quangos. We're going to make your politics better value for money as well as cleaner. I think that's part of the apology we really badly need to make. "

That's what we are saying in our manifesto, education will be part-time or full-time till the age of 18. As far as grades and standards are concerned, I myself believe in the highest of standards. I believe if we don't search for the highest of standards, then we will not in the end get the best pupils coming out of our schools. Yes, we've got to look at the different types of exams and we will do so. But I think it's important to realise we're in this new world where we are competing with Asia, as well as America and Europe and our young people have got to have the grades, the qualifications to be able to meet the best in the world.

I think there is a danger that our education system has become terribly bureaucratic. We send 4,000 pages of information to schools every year. We spend \u00a3300 million on educational quangos. We're not getting enough to the frontline, following the child into the school. As someone who has got two children, one of whom started at a state school in London, and hopefully another child to come, I'm passionate about getting as much money into the school as possible, rather than wasting it in Whitehall. In terms of exams, we've got to have good external marking, done properly, and high standards. I think that's absolutely key. I wouldn't want to see that change.

I just read the other day that head teachers now by e-mail over the last year, have received - get this - 4,000 pages of instructions from on high from Whitehall. This is crazy. We've got to let head teachers teach, we've got to let teachers teach. We've got to reinstil a sense of enthusiasm and creativity in the way that you are taught. That's why we want to do, the Liberal Democrats, is to put on to the statute book an Education Freedom Act which literally bans government from micromanaging what happens every minute of the day with every single test in every classroom in the country. That's what I'd like to see. I think it would make a big difference to you and other people who are at school. "

Next year, down to zero, as a result of the fact that we're allowing federations, academies, to take over underperforming schools. That's the way forward, to insist on the highest standards, to make sure an underperforming school is taken over, to make sure we invest enough in the education system to ensure our children are properly taught. What I'd be very worried about is if in this difficult and straitened time, we were to cut our budgets for education at this point in time.

In a typical year now, you get 17,000 teachers being attacked by students. We've got a real problem here. There was a case in Manchester once where a child produced a knife in a school, got excluded, and then the appeals panel put that child back into the school. Imagine what that does to the head teacher that's trying to keep order. So we say head teachers should be able to exclude difficult pupils and not be overruled by appeals panels. We say you've got to change the rules so teachers can keep order in class. Right now, we seem to be treating the teacher like children and the children like the adults. We've got it topsy-turvy, the wrong way round, and we really need to change that so that we have proper discipline and order. Then people can learn. "

I think creativity is important in the classroom, and think freedom for teachers and head teachers. One thing which I think would really help in all of those things - discipline, creativity, freedom for teachers - is quite simply good old-fashioned smaller class sizes. We have 8,000 infants in this country now between the ages of five and seven who are in classes which are so big, they're illegal, technically illegal. It's just logical. If you're a teacher, friends of mine who are teachers say they can't really keep an eye on the troublemakers, but they also can't support the brightest children if the classes are huge. That's why we've got a plan, fully costed, to provide schools with additional resources so that they can bring down the average class size in a primary school, for instance down to 20, and the average class size in a secondary school down to 16.

I come back to this need to combine two things: firstly, more freedom for teachers and head teachers. Remember this crazy thing I told you about head teachers getting 4,000 pages of instructions by e-mail, and secondly, smaller class sizes, more one-to-one tuition, Saturday morning classes, evening classes, so that you can help those children in particular who perhaps aren't being supported at home as much as anybody else.

Take \u00a36 billion out and it is the equivalent of taking out thousands of jobs in this economy today and making a lot of jobs that are safe at the moment unsafe. I would not recommend that at all.

        "Let me take on, Robert, this argument directly, the idea that if you cut waste this year, you endanger the recovery. Just this week, we've seen two I think pretty hideous waste stories. The first is that civil servants have been given credit cards funded by the tax-payer to go out and spend that on food, wine and other things, and that's cost \u00a31 billion. The second story was that managers in the National Health Service, many of whom are paid over \u00a3250,000, have had a 7% pay rise. Are we honestly saying that if you didn't have that sort of waste, that sort of excess, that our economy would collapse? I think it's nonsense. It's like saying that giving up smoking is somehow going to be bad for your health. Giving up waste would be good for our economy, and it would mean that we could stop this tax rise that's coming down the track, that Britain's biggest business leaders all say will cost jobs. Cut the waste, stop the tax. That's the right answer. "

Of course we can get rid of a bit of waste. But that isn't the big... That doesn't really address the big questions we need to ask ourselves. I think we need to be clear with you, open with you, straight with you. We've tried to do that. We've set out \u00a315 billion worth of savings. I've listed some of them. We have one specific tax that we want to introduce to help fill the black hole. We would impose a 10% tax on the profits of the banks, these banks who have got us into the trouble in the first place. I think they should pay you back because you, the taxpayer, have bailed them out, and use that money to deal with the black hole in the finances. Let's not get obsessed about mythical savings and waste, which is the oldest trick in the book, to pretend that you can square a circle like that. Or get obsessed about when you deliver these cuts. The crucial thing is, are we going to be open with people, with you, about how we're going to save money in the long-term? "

I fear for our economy if that happens. The only way we've kept our economy moving forward is not because there's been private investment or bank lending, it's because the government has had to step in to make sure there is sufficient growth. We've prevented unemployment going to the levels of America and Europe. I say you've got to keep that support now. Every other European country, America, agrees with that. Only the Conservative Party is against keeping that support in the economy now. Now, of course we've got to deal with waste, but if you take the waste out, you put more money into the economy to make sure the economy can continue to grow. It's the only way we can save jobs and businesses in this country now. I say to the whole audience here and to the nation: it is important at this moment to take no risk with the recovery.

And let us remember all those who lost their lives in Afghanistan. The important thing is that we're doing the right thing by our troops. And that's why we've increased the spending on equipment dramatically over these last few years. A thousand new vehicles, new helicopters brought into Afghanistan.

They attach them onto their vehicles, and when the rollers move over mines, the mines blow up, but of course, they destroy the rollers and not the soldiers. The American army says that those rollers, diesigned, manufactured by a great British business in Sheffield, have saved 140 lives. Why is it they're not being used by the British army? Apparently they don't somehow fit on to the vehicles that our soldiers use. So I think it's not only that we've got to make sure that we don't waste money on bureaucrats in the Ministry of Defence and all the rest of it, and instead spend that on equipment for our brave servicemen and servicewomen, we should also use the know- how and the manufacturing brilliance expertise in this country to provide our brave soldiers with the equipment which saves lives on the front line.

We've got to build up the Afghan army, build up the police force in Afghanistan. Our brave troops are helping to train the Afghan army and police at the moment, and that's how we will gradually see the numbers of Afghan forces rise and our troops come down in number so that our troops can come home.

The last year under this government, they've employed 5,000 more managers in the NHS, yet the maternity ward in the NHS hospital where my third son was born just over a year ago is threatened with closure. This government spent \u00a312 billion on a computer testimony in the NHS which doesn't work, yet I was in Burnley the other day, I think Jacqueline was saying you come from Burnley.

We will make sure that that finance is there.

The government has had 13 years to fix these problems, and it hasn't done. Gordon Brown talks about cancer, but what he's not telling you is that there are people in our country, there was a case the other day of someone who had to sell their home to get the cancer drugs. And the Prime Minister, the government, is about to hit the NHS, Britain's biggest employer, with this National Insurance rise. It's going to take \u00a3200 million out of our National Health Service. We say stop that National Insurance rise, and instead spend the money on a cancer drugs fund, so people can get the drugs they need. Talk about guarantees, but the fact is for some people, waiting two weeks to see a consultant is too long. We need a faster, choice-driven system, but the drugs have got to be there when you need them. They're not always right now.  "

Every man, woman and child in this country spends \u00a32,000 on the NHS through our tax system. I want to judge the NHS about how it helps me and my family when we're ill, sick and in need of NHS care, not just by numbers plucked out of thin air. David Cameron, you simply cannot seriously suggest that we should believe that you can cut the deficit immediately as you want, then have a whole blizzard of tax breaks, including a great big tax break for double millionaires in the inheritance tax system, and provide huge lashings of extra money to the public services. You might be able to do one of those things. You can't do all three. I want to say to people, let's be straight with you. We have to find savings in the NHS. I want to see strategic health authorities, which is a layer of bureaucracy, stripped away altogether and use that money on the frontline NHS services which are so important to us. "

There are drugs budgets that are going up, and we say you need that extra money to even keep going with the NHS. That's why we make the exception of the NHS and say that's the budget that has to go up. What Gordon Brown is not telling you about the situation with cancer, cancer drugs and cancer outcomes is, after all the things he's talked about, all the money that's gone in, our death rate from cancer is actually worse than Bulgaria's. So all that's happened has not actually improved the outcome, which is what matters. "

Tragically, two of them have died because they couldn't get the drug Sutent that they wanted, that was on the market, that people knew was a good drug. That's a scandal in our country today.

When are each individual party going to introduce a fairer system to care for the elderly when it is required, especially those who have worked and contributed towards the country's economy, without the need for them to sell and dispose of their assets? And what are your policies? "

        "CAMERON", 
        "Thank you, Alan, for asking this question. I think it's an absolutely vital question. I think it's so unfair that today you can have people who have worked hard all their lives, they've saved, they've paid down the mortgage, they've done all the right things, and yet if they go into residential care, they have to spend every penny of that money. And maybe the neighbour who didn't work hard, didn't save, and went about things in a different way, they get the whole thing paid for for free. I think that's just not fair. So we have... As we know, there is a huge budget deficit, a great big hole left by Gordon Brown, so we can't make all care free, I don't think we can afford that. What we can do is say to people, if you put aside \u00a38,000 on turning 65, we can guarantee that you won't have to pay for residential care. That would remove the need to sell your home to pay for care. It would mean you could pass your home on to your children rather than have to pay for your care bills. It doesn't solve the whole problem, but I think it'd be a good start, a fair start, in rewarding the people who have done the right thing.  "
    ],

        "CLEGG", 
        "I think, Alan, this is one of those rare issues where the issue is so big, and the costs are potentially so great, and it affects every family, it affects every individual, that I think this is one of those issues where I would say, it is worth the politicians setting aside their political differences for once and trying to come up with a solution everybody can agree with. We've all got different ideas. We have ideas, proposals, that there's a contribution from the individual and the state. David Cameron's ideas, which helps some but doesn't help people in their home. Gordon Brown has some ideas which help some of the most needy, but not others. Why don't we for once, given this is something which I think is bigger than any other party, actually work together? There are some things, however, that I think we can do immediately. I, for instance, would like to use the money that the government has allocated for its latest, I think slightly flawed, proposals, to give respite care to the carers who look after loved ones, those who looked after loved ones for the greatest amount of time, give them respite for at least a week every year. That's something we can do now. Let's come up with a longer term proposal together. "
    ], 
    [
        "BROWN", 
        "Elderly people should not have to choose between the home they own and the care they need. We have to devise a better system for the future. That's why the first stage of it is urgent-needs care. So you can stay in your own home, you don't have to go into a nursing home, you get the support you need to stay in your own home free of charge. We're introducing that from April next year. The second stage in the next parliament is to say to people, if you're in an old people's home and you're in that home for more than two years, it will be free for personal and medical care from then onwards. That will take away the worry and anxiety people feel that their own home will have to be sold to meet the costs of residential care. The third stage will be to move to a more comprehensive system where people can be guaranteed that their needs will be met in the long run. I agree with Nick, we want consensus on this, we want to proceed in a way that every party, that every part of the country is with us. That's why we are consulting the social care groups, setting up a new commission to look at the finding for the future after the next parliament, but we're committed to urgent needs being met now. "

        "It isn't a small problem about people having to sell their homes to pay for care. I believe it's 45,000 families every year who have to do that. As I say, I think there's a deep unfairness in the system. "
    ], 
    [
        "CAMERON", 
        "Look, all of us, when we we get older, want to spend as long as possible at home before going into residential care. Anything we can do to help people adapt their homes and live in their homes, and also to help the carers, if carers stopped caring in Britain, whether for disabled children or elderly people, if they packed up and gave up, that would cost us \u00a350 billion as well as the hurt and pain it would cause. So giving carers clearer rights and saying if you care for someone, you should get a break. The thing every carer says to me more than anything else is, \"Give me a break every now and again, and I can go on doing what I do\". I hope as we try and seek some consensus, let's put the carer absolutely up front and centre. They're Britain's unsung heroes. "
    ], 
    [
        "CLEGG", 
        "Of course, I agree with that. There are about a million carers in this country who care, I think, for 50 hours or more for their loved ones, for members of their family who need care. They are the unsung army of heroines and heroes that keep our society together. They desperately need time for themselves, time to go on holiday. Under our plans, what we could do immediately is give those million carers who care for the greatest length of time at least a week off - at least a week off - just to have a breather, spend some time on their own, visit friends, go on holiday, have some time to themselves again. But as I say, I think we've all got some ideas, but I don't think any of us - and you don't hear this from politicians very much - I don't think any of us, if we're really honest with you, have got the perfect solution. That's why I think this is so important. Let's for once put people before politics and come up with a solution that works for you and your family in the long run. "

        "We have tried to do something about respite care. There are six million carers in this country. I've met many of them and talked to them about their needs. One need is respite, so that they can have a break, as Nick said. We're introducing, and have actually made provision, for more measures for respite care. But the questioner was asking about, also, how he could be sure that he could be less worried about having to go into an old people's home, or what would happen if he got ill later on in his life. That's why the urgent-needs measure we're introducing from April next year is so important. It means that you can stay in your own home, have the help that is available, the equipment, but also the home helps and the health visitors, and at the moment, it is being means-tested. Now, in future, it will be free of charge. "

        "CAMERON", 
        "I think one of the biggest things we must do is, I think it's right to try and forge a consensus, because this is a long-term issue we must deal with, is to try and give the carer and those they care for more power and control and influence over their lives. Form an individual budget for each one. Make sure that if they want to, they can take that as a direct payment, they can make decisions about the sort of respite they need. We tried to do this with my son, and when you try and get a direct payment system so you're in charge of the money and you can try and get some help, it's unbelievably complicated. You've got so set up a separate bank account, you've got to read about four lever-arch files. I found it testing enough. What someone who's recently had to start caring, who's under huge pressure, maybe getting ill of what they're doing, to try and get direct payments, let's make it easier. We ought to be trusting people to do this. "

I want carers to be able to manage their own budgets as well, and that's something we're really working on for the future as well. But we've got to find a solution to this big problem. The big problem is, people don't want to have to make the choice between owning their home and getting the care they need. That's why in the next parliament, it's important to try with the commission to reach a consensus on what the funding will be for the future. "

Whether it is on the questions from Alan on care, Jacqueline on crime, Helen on politics, Joel on schooling, Robert on the deficit, I believe we can answer all of those questions.  I believe we can rise to all of those challenges if we say no to the old parties and yes to something new and something different.  That's what I offer and that's what the Liberal Democrats offer.  So don't let them tell you that the only choice is between two old parties who have been playing pass the parcel with your government for 65 years now - making the same promises, breaking the same promises. Making the same old mistakes over and over again.  I think, despite all the challenges, all the problems we have, I think we can be really hopeful about the future.

I know we're not up against The X Factor or Britain's Got Talent and I hope people have been able to stay with us in the exchange that we've had about the future policies of this country.  I was really struck with a number of questions, but particularly the one from Robert about the future of his healthcare trust and about the jobs that may be at risk.  I've got to come to this central problem that we've got at the moment: we've got to make a decision now about how we secure the recovery this year. We've got to make a decision about whether we put funds into the economy or take funds out of the economy.  Now, I'm very clear we mustn't make the mistakes of the 1930s or the 1980s when unemployment rose for five years after the official end of the recession.  So we've got to make sure the money is in the economy this year so that the recovery is secure. And then we've got to make sure that as we cut the deficit, we are fair to our National Health Service, our policing, and fair to our schools.  And that's why the National Insurance rise is necessary, to protect our health service, our schools and our police.  I think it was very interesting when David Cameron was asked, he couldn't give a guarantee that we are giving about the funding on schools, he couldn't give a guarantee about the funding on policing.  And when it came to the National Health Service, he couldn't give the same personal guarantees that we're giving about cancer specialist care, about seeing a GP at the evenings and weekends.  Now these are problems he's got to address in the future.  I look forward to the next debate so we can get all the issues raised, aired about the future of our country.   "

If you're old and you become ill, we will always be there for you. This is an amazing country.  We've done incredible things. I think we can go on and do even more incredible things but we need two things: a government with the right values and also an understanding that we're all in this together and real change comes when we come together and work together.
