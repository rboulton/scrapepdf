If it's all about style and PR, count me out. If it's about the big decisions, if it's about judgment, it's delivering a better future for this country, I'm your man. Ahead are huge challenges, delivering the economic recovery in jobs, bringing our brave troops safely home from Afghanistan, keeping our streets free of terrorism, building alliances in Europe against nuclear weapons, against climate change, against poverty and to deal with our banks. Now, not everyone has the answers, but I say get the big decisions wrong and Britain's security and jobs are at risk. Get the big decisions right, and we can have a prosperous, fairer, greener and better Britain. Like me or not, I can deliver that plan. The way to do it is with a majority Labour government.  "

If you vote Conservative, you will get a new team running the country from May 7th. And you won't be stuck with what you've got now. But real change comes from your values, and there, there are big differences between us. I believe that we need to do more to help families. They are the absolute bedrock of a strong society. I want government to be accountable. I want less waste, less bureaucracy. Stopping the jobs tax, but making sure we have good public services that you get good value for money for. As we're going to discuss tonight, I want us to keep our defences strong, I want to keep our borders secure and our country safe. But real change, real change comes not just from politicians, but from when we all recognise that we have responsibilities. We're all in this together, and that's how we will build the big and strong society I believe we need in our country. "

We shouldn't be facing allegations of complicity in torture, we shouldn't have invaded Iraq. So I want us to lead in the world. I want us to lead in Europe, not complain from the sidelines. I want us to lead in creating a world free of nuclear weapons. And I want us to lead on the biggest challenge of all, climate change. My family knows what British values really mean.

I want us to be in Europe but not run by Europe. There will... you'll hear big differences between me and the other two parties. I don't want us to join the euro, I want I want us to keep the pound as our currency. I don't want us to give up the British rebate. I want to make sure we get value for money for what we put into Europe. I want to cut some of the bureaucracy, some of the rules, some of the regulations that I think drive business so mad. That's the agenda you'd get from a Conservative government in Europe. To those who say somehow this would be isolation, I say nonsense. President Sarkozy of France, he stands up for France in Europe.

Anything that takes 15 years to define chocolate is not a model of democratic efficiency. What I also learned was this, that there are a whole load of things, whether we like it or not, whatever your views on Europe and the european Union, which we simply can't do on our own. We can't deal with international crime that touches and affects every single community in this country on our own. We can't deal with climate change on our own. The weather doesn't stop at the cliffs of Dover. We can't regulate these wretched banks that got us into so much in the first place which now sprawl across countries.

Half our trade is with the European Union. 750,000 businesses - I'm sorry it's not your business, raising the question about the building trade - but 750,000 businesses trade with Europe. The idea that we should again be isolated and on the margins and not in the mainstream of Europe would be a terrible, terrible mistake. Now, I worked with the European leaders through the global financial crisis. I had to persuade them that we had to restructure our banks and they had to restructure their banks. I had to persuade them they had to work with America in the G20, but when Europe and America works together, we are so much stronger. Stronger to deal with climate change, which is one much my priorities, stronger to deal with the economy, stronger to deal with international crime, stronger to deal with terrorism, let us never again be an empty chair in Europe.

I think one of the reasons that people are so angry is that politicians at Westminster have given away powers to Brussels without asking us, the people, first. I think people felt particularly cheated when the European constitution came forward and we were told we were going to get a referendum and Gordon Brown and Labour stopped that from happening and Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats didn't vote with us to get that referendum. We should have had one. People feel cheated by that. As a result, one of the things I would do if I was your Prime Minister is straightaway pass a law through parliament that says if ever there's a future occasion when laws are being proposed to pass power from Westminster to Brussels, there will be a guarantee of a referendum held in our country. You send us to parliament to make decisions, make laws, discuss the issues, yes. You don't send us there to give away powers that belong to you.

Look, we do need to have a referendum the next time there's a big transfer of powers to the European Union but it needs to be on the fundamental issue: do we stay in or do we go out? You have a right to make that choice in a referendum. I would argue we should stay in, not because it's perfect but because it's in our interests to do so. Let me give you, Christopher, a very concrete example. There was some time agoa operation by European police authorities which broke open a paedophile ring. They arrested 100 sex offenders, many of them in this country. And they released 20 young women from unimaginable abuse and servitude. something called Operation Koala. ou can Google it and look it up. Guess what? Conservative MEPs, UK Independence Party MEPs voted against the measures which made that possible. That is putting dogma above the safety of children. We are safer together, we're weaker apart.  "

That's what gives us paid holidays. He'd have to break up the European Union meeting and say, \"Look, 26 of you are against this, I'm the only one who's standign for this\". And what would happen? We are trying to get an economic recovery. That depends on economic recovery, depending on Germany, France and other countries growing as well.  Taking our exports. We have to get an agreement on climate change because of what happened at Copenhagen. Again, that would be postponed because we would be having a big argument as we did in the past with a Conservative government about repatriating powers in Britain. We've got other props we've got to deal with and these include security and terrorism. These are the issues. Let's look to the future.

That to me is the same old politics. Let me just ask this important point: this idea that somehow an in-out referendum is what the public wants I don't think is right, it's a con. What people want when a new treaty comes along, when a constitution comes along, is to have that choice to vote on that constitution. "

What would have been a con would be to have a referendum on one individual treaty, which, even if we'd had the referendum, and then we'd rejected the treaty, would have allowed, Christopher, the European Union to carry on exactly as before. Let's have the fundamental debate. I worked in my previous life before going into politics for a while as a negotiator on behalf of all of us, on behalf of Britain and the European Union, negotiating trade deals with the Chinese government, the Russian government and others. What I noticed there was that the Chinese and the Russians, they only listened to what we were saying because I was representing the largest single market in the world of 475 million consumers. Now, of course there are daft rules, of course it does daft things, but it seems to me that we punch above our weight when we stand together in Europe in a world, frankly, where you've got a lot of superpowers bumping up against each other and where, to coin a phrase, size does matter.

David's walked away from the European People's Party, which is an alliance of the centre, progressive parties in Europe, and gone in with a group of right-wing extremists. I want to work with the sensible people in Europe to get jobs for our British economy. If we don't trade with Europe, we lose jobs, we lose businesses, we lose growth.

The problem, of course, is we have done it in a manner where I don't think we've pursued the right strategy, we haven't given the right equipment to our troops. We haven't had proper international co-ordination on the ground in Afghanistan, we haven't worked properly with other countries in the region to do so.

We are having to take action with our multilateral partners to deal with these problems, and will continue to have to do so. Why are we in Afghanistan, and why we have we got to be vigilant all the time? The reason is, there is a chain of terror that links these Al-Qaeda groups in different parts of the world to action that could happen in the United Kingdom. Every week I get a report, sometimes every day, of terrorist plots, most of which arise in the Afghanistan/Pakistan area, and we have got to deal with. To keep the streets safe in Britain, we have to take on Al-Qaeda wherever it is. I also have to say about Afghanistan that this is a mission that can work. The reason is, we are training up the Afghan soldiers and the Afghan police. So whenever we are in a mission abroad, we have to make sure that we have a means by which, in that country, they can build up their own security staff, so we can bring our troops home.

If you look at future operations like that, we have to learn from the mistakes of the past. We have to make sure we plan properly, we've got to make sure we never send our troops into battle again without the proper equipment, without the proper helicopters. We have to think through not just what we are doing militarily, but actually is the aid there, are we helping these people? Do we have a political strategy for how we are going to get out of that country once we have tried to make it safe with our allies?

I wouldn't carry on spending money on the Eurofighter Typhoon, the third tranche of that Eurofighter project, consuming billions of pounds. I don't think it's right to do what both David Cameron and Gordon Brown want, which is now to commit, before we need to make a decision, to spend up to \u00a3100 billion renewing, exactly in the same old way, the Cold War Trident nuclear missile system.

Look, what happened on Christmas Eve was a bomber who would have been in Detroit and bombing that plane, came from Somalia. That was really where he was given his orders from. So we have got to deal with Al-Qaeda in Somalia and Yemen, as well as in Pakistan. We've got to be clear, that we cannot allow terrorists to have territory in the world that then they use as a base for attacking the United Kingdom.

I actually, to prepare for this debate, I went for a run this morning with someone who just got back from Afghanistan this morning, I couldn't keep up, he was someone who'd served for six months and had done an incredible job there. Just going back to the point about how we get these things right, one of the things that strikes you when you go to Afghanistan is that actually we are not getting things right politically. The south of the country is where Taliban grew, where they came from, that is the Pashtun part of the country. Yet when you see the Afghan National Army, it is dominated by people from the other parts of the country. There is a really big political issue there. We have to make sure the whole country in Afghanistan feels it's part of the Afghan Government. That's absolutely key for making sure we can bring our soldiers back home. Not just training the Afghan army and police, as Gordon said, vital though that is, we need a political settlement as well to help make sure we can come home.  "

Unless we can provide the necessary resources. I remember when I was in Helmand visiting the troops there, I talked to some mechanics, who look after the vehicles. They were telling me that they had been on a convoy previously which normally just takes one day to from one place to another, it took them a week, because every time the vehicle broke down in the sands there, they didn't have the necessary parts, they had to take parts from other vehicles. So, if we do this again, we cannot, cannot, cannot allow eight years to elapse, which is what's happened, until proper equipment is finally been provided to our very, very courageous servicemen and servicewomen. Look, we've had to change our tactics all the time because of what the Taliban has been doing. Originally, they wanted to win a face-to-face war with us, fighting person-to-person. Now they use explosive devices, these explosive devices are designed to scare as well as to maim our own troops. We have had to change our tactics and therefore bring in the explosive experts, bring in the metal detectors, bring in the drones to survey the land, make sure we have the proper intelligence, go into Pakistan and deal with the making of bombs as well. All these things have had to happen and we've had to change our tactics again because we want to train up the Afghan police and army so we're partnering with the Afghan police. I'd like to say to our troops, come back into the barracks and you will be safe. But I can't say that, because our strategy in Afghanistan depends on contact with the local people, persuading them they are safe with us, and safe in an Afghanistan free of the Taliban. We have had to change, yes, but it's response to the tactics of our opponents.  "

And I profoundly believe that we are safer having an independent nuclear deterrent in an unsafe and uncertain world, a proper replacement to Trident, because we simply don't know what the world will look like in 40 years time. I think it's a real risk, as the Liberal Democrats say, first to be opposed to an independent nuclear deterrent, now to say they do want one, but it's not the same as Trident, but they can't tell us what it is. You can't take risks with this. It's really important you get it right.  "

President Obama said last week, I think quite rightly, that now the greatest threat to us is not the Cold War threats of old, it's terrorists getting hold of dirty bombs, Trident isn't going to help you with that. Let's move with the times, take decisions when we need to take them, and at least have this review, which I talked about , after the election and consider everything that is possible. I have to deal with these decisions every day, I say to you, Nick, get real, get real. Because Iran, you are saying, might be able to have a nuclear weapon, and you wouldn't take action against them, but you're saying we've got to give up our Trident submarines and our nuclear weapon now.

In fact, we found, far better, even in this area where there's not much sun is a solar panel. I would recommend people if they can to use this form of energy because it allows us to heat our water in a way that is far more environmentally friendly. Weve gotthe first Climate Change Act in the world, we are due to reduce emissions substantially by 2020 and 2030, there is a lot more to be done both individually and as a community.

But I don't do enough. I'm acutely aware I don't do enough, I'm like many, many people, I wish I could and would do more. Part of the problem, because you referred specifically, Nicola, to aeroplanes, and you're quite right that flights at least when they are able to fly, and there isn't too much volcanic ash around, do create a growing proportion of the CO2 emissions, so we need to tackle it. I think what is irrational is the moment you have a tax system which taxes passengers in aeroplanes, that means that planes with freight in them, for instance, aren't taxed, to reflect the pollution they cause. You've got lots of planes that are half empty or barely got any passengers at all. If you changed it to a plane tax, you would make a dramatic difference in cutting down on unnecessary aviation pollution.  "

We want 15% renewables by 2020, with the world's leading offshore wind power at the moment, and we want to do more in every area of renewables. The question I have to ask the two other parties is this, why, Nick, are you so against nuclear power, because it is the means to balance off our energy supply, without having the dependence on oil.

And we will have companies, Marks & Spencers and others have expressed an interest, to come and carry out that work and pay for it and share with you the reduction in the bills.

I just think it's extraordinarily expensive, very, very expensive indeed. There are some calculations that it would lead to average energy bills increasing in this country rather than decreasing. It takes a long, long, long time to build these nuclear plants. All the experts agree that it would take well into the next decade to create new nuclear energy, which would be too late to deal with the energy problems we have now. For a fraction of the money that I think both David Cameron and Gordon Brown want to spend on subsidising the nuclear industry, we could develop mass insulation programmes of our homes, our schools and our hospitals. Remember, 27% of all carbon dioxide emissions in this country go straight out of your window, through the roof of your house. If we only used energy more efficiently and also, of course, invested some of the money which would be wasted on big nuclear projects on wind energy and other renewable energies, I think that is the way towards a sustainable future.

They're in the business of helping insulation and giving people advice about the use of energy. So we're trying to do this at the moment and we will do more in future years. Yes, we've got to insulate our houses, yes, we've got to have carbon-free homes where possible, yes, we've got to have the electric car, we're investing in that, the hybrid car, and yes, we've got to develop offshore wind power.

And I want him to come to Britain for two reasons: one is the Catholic Church is a great part of our society, and we should recognise it as such, and I hope every British citizen wants to see this visit by the Pope take place.

They now say, which is good, say they do welcome that. You're the boss, you're the boss. The other thing of course we need to do is clean up all the murky business of party funding. We've all had problems with party funding. Again, there was a deal, there was a deal on the table, we supported it, to clean up party funding. Yet again, the old parties said no. Gordon Brown wanted to protect his trade union pay masters, David Cameron wanted to protect his paymaster in Belize. I think we all agree on the rhetoric of cleaning up politics, but we actually have to act. I'd say one final thing: one of the reasons why your friends and your neighbours are perhaps right in saying they feel ignored is because we have this very odd electoral system which allows Gordon Brown the Prime Minister to be in power when only 22% of people voted for his party last time, many people are being ignored and we need to change that as well.

That is immensely exciting. There are lots of especially young people, I hope I'm not out of turn saying you look fairly young, who might be in your position, who feel.. who felt for so long completely turned off by the old Party Politics, and they are now excited, they're beginning to hope, they're beginning to think that we can do something different this time. that's what I think. I think we can do something different this time. But get stuck in, if you didn't vote before, if you didn't register, register. It's your country, it's your future, assert your right to vote, assert your right to shape your own future. I think then we could make this election one of the most exciting elections we have had in a very long time.  "

We have to be very clear, we want nobody standing at this election who is not transparent and open about what they are doing.

But if you then ask the question, ah, but my job may depend on decisions that are made by government, then people say, ah, I might be interested. People then say my health service may depend on how much resources Government is prepared to invest in the health service, then people say, yes, politics may make a difference.

What are we doing now? We're going to link pensions to earnings in 2012, so every pension will be linked to earnings and not just prices. Secondly, women, and you are one of them, who have not had the full state pension, we are making it possible for all women in future to have that full state pension. And thirdly, of course, we've got to deal with the poverty that people face as pensioners. That is why the pension credit, the winter fuel allowance, all these things have been introduced. The free concessionary travel as well, the free television licenses over 75, all of these have been introduced over the last few years, because the one thing that scandalises our society above all else is that we cannot give dignity and security to all pensioners in retirement.

The reason I feel I can give you that answer with total confidence, that we will really deliver this, is we have made a tough decision to go with it. Which is to say from 2016, we are going to ask, starting with men, to retire a year later. That means we can fund this pledge. Because we all know we have an enormous budget deficit, there isn't any money left in the kitty. So if we're going to make promises like that, and it's a big promise, an important promise, we have to say how we are going to pay for it. I want to make sure that when we see people going into old age that if you have worked hard, if you've saved, if you've put money aside, you are not punished.

Something which I'm sure you're familiar with, which is there are so many other costs which the elderly have to confront, which really do make it extremely difficult to make ends meet. Fuel costs. We have just had a very cold winter for example, it's a very good example. I got a letter a few months ago from an elderly couple, who said to me they now found it so difficult to heat their homes on cold winter days, that on those cold winter days, they get into a bus in their town and travel around the bus just to stay warm. That is wrong. It is wrong that energy companies charge you more for the first bits of energy that you use in your home than the later bits. That means someone who's heating a great big five- storey mansion is paying cheaper, paying less for their energy than someone who's just heating a one bedroom flat.

That's what we're introducing over the next few months, so that people don't have to go into old people's homes.

If we win the election outright, I'd do everything I can to take the country with us on some of these difficult decisions and also try and take other politicians with us because there will be some hard times before we get out of this, actually get the deficit sorted. But there is a problem in that you do need to have agreement. There is a fundamental disagreement between me and the other two parties about what we do this year. I think we badly need to roll up our sleeves and make some savings this year so we can stop the jobs tax, the national National Insurance tax rise, that is coming down the road. When you've got an economy that is trying to recover, the worst thing you can do is put tax on every single job in our country. That's why it's over 1,100 business leaders have said don't do this. They've said very clearly the threat to our recovery is not cutting waste, the threat is the jobs tax. The others don't agree about that, but I badly think we really, really need to stop this tax that could kill our recovery and kill jobs.  "

David Cameron says he'll try and make a hung parliament work but spends all his time in the newspapers this week making those ludicrous claims about total meltdown as if the world will end. The world won't end and it will be your choice. If you decide that no-one here deserves an outright majority, then we'll need to be open about it and talk to each other, talk to each other to provide the good government, sound government that you deserve, because you deserve a government where we put your interests first and don't allow everything constantly to be hijacked by short-term political point-scoring.

I invited people who are businessmen and women to come into the government to work with us for national economic benefit. I will continue to ask people to give their talents to public service, and that is something that is really important to do. But there is this fundamental position about this year. I think we've got to resolve this. I have had to take the economy through the most global financial crisis. We made the right decisions to take ownership of the banks, and the right decisions to get the world together to deal with that recession. Every time, we've said we have to support the economy through difficult times. Now, what David is saying even when it is fragile, he wants, for ideological reasons I think, to take \u00a36 billion out of the economy. That puts thousands of jobs, teachers, it puts policemen, it puts thousands of jobs at risk immediately, and that's why they're talking about an emergency budget in June.

To go back to Frank's question, I do have one specific proposal where we really think we should come together much more effectively. That is, I want to see the National Security Council sitting as a war cabinet from day one if I become Prime Minister. Because, day one, Afghanistan is the top priority, getting it right. I would invite, as Prime Minister, the leaders of the other two main parties to come to that meeting several times a year to make sure they were really seeing the advice we were getting from the security services, from the generals, from the Chiefs of Staff.

I want to see a border police force, we have every right to police our borders. Secondly, I would make sure we direct people who come and live and work in the country, to the areas in the country where, of course, they have a job and they've got someone who can vouch for them, but also where there is space for them to live, where there isn't unreasonable strain placed on public services. And thirdly, we have to do something about the legacy about the problem created by the chaos which Labour and Conservative governments created in our immigration system. That was lots of people coming here illegally, who are now still living, years and years and years, in the shadows of our economy. I'd rather get them out of the hands of criminal gangs, so we can go after the criminal gangs, into the hands of the taxman, if they want to play by the rules, pay their taxes, speak English.

I think that would be not a deterrent on people coming to our country illegally, it would mean that more and more people would come into our country. Our policy is to control and manage immigration. We have a points system to do so. No unskilled worker from outside Europe can now come into our country. If you have a skill, then we will get a British person to do that job advertised in a Jobcentre if the skill is available in Britain. We are gradually reducing the number of skills we need to come from abroad. So cooks and care assistants in future, they will come from abroad, they're trained up in Britain.

I think that's really important to say that, first up. I do believe that immigration in recent years has just simply been too high. We do need to bring the level down. That is the first bit of fairness that needs to be sorted out. People do want this addressed. The other two parties are not actually really addressing this issue. We believe you do need to have a cap on people coming from outside the European Union, for economic reasons. That would help to bring it down. Added to that, is new European countries, when they join the EU, we say there should be transitional controls. We were told there would only be 13,000 people coming from Poland, in the end there were hundreds of thousands. That is absolutely vital, we are the only ones saying, let's grip this, let's have a cap, let's bring it down radically. Then it won't be a political issue.

Gordon Brown talks about an amnesty, the only person actually in British politics advocating a blanket amnesty, I'm not, it's Boris Johnson, the Conservative mayor for London. What I'm saying is you can't live in denial of a problem which has been created by the chaos of the immigration system in the past. You can wish away, if either of you wish, that there are people who have been living here for a long time in the shadows of our economy. I want to go after the criminal gangs who are exploiting those people. If there are those people who've lived here for ten years, speak English, want to play by the rules, want to pay their taxes, why don't we say to them, OK, you come out of the shadows, pay your taxes, do some community service to make up for the fact that you came here illegally, and then we can free up resources to go after the criminal gangs.

It was got rid of in the past, it should not have been got rid of. We are bringing that back. Biometric visas mean that we can stop people at airports even before they come into the country if they've not got the right identification. So we're tightening up on that. But the big key to the future is the points system. If you don't have the points to come into this country, in other words if you don't have a skill we need, don't come to the country. But I must say, I'm very worried about Nick's policy, because it sends a message to people all around the world, if you come to Britain there'll be some sort of amnesty that will allow you to come here freely in the end, without having to be thrown out of the country.

It's been shown all over Europe that what that leads to is a big increase in false asylum claims and more immigration. That's a bad idea.

We're a great country in so many different ways, with the right leadership, with the right values, with a clean break from these 13 years of failure, we can achieve anything if we pull together and build the big society we all know we need to make our country a better place to live in.

        "What I have tried to do tonight is to show if we do things differently, we can be a force for good in the world. We can lead, we can shape the world around us, not complain about the world around us. We have talked about a number of things this evening. We've talked about Europe, Afghanistan, climate change, the Pope. We've talked about things closer to home as well, immigration, MPs' expenses, pensions. I believe, on all those things, all those issues, we can act differently. There's still some way to go before this election is decided, but I hope that whether you're going to vote in the next few days by post, or make up your mind in the ballot box on May 6th, you agree with me that something really exciting is beginning to happen. People are beginning to believe, beginning to hope that we can do something different this time. Of course there are people who will try to block change, of course there are people who are spreading fear to stop the change you want. I think they're wrong. I think if we do things differently, if we stand up for the value's that have made our country great, then we can be proud again, proud of greater fairness here at home, and proud also, of standing up for the things we believe in, in the world. We don't simply need to choose from the old choices of the past, we don't need to repeat the mistakes of the past. Don't let anyone tell you this time it can't be different. It can. "

        "And that concludes this Sky News leaders' debate. Full reaction and analysis continues, of course, now here live on Sky News. The third and final debate in this general election series will take place next week in the Midlands. After that, of course, it's up to you to cast your vote on May 6th. Many thanks to you for watching, thanks to our questioners, to the our studio audience, and to the people of Bristol. And above all many thanks to our three leaders, the first ever to agree to debate live on television. Gordon Brown, David Cameron, and Nick Clegg who I now invite to step forward and shake hands with each other. APPLAUSE  "
