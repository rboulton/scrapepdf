Ahead are huge challenges, delivering the economic recovery in jobs, bringing our brave troops safely home from Afghanistan, keeping our streets free of terrorism, building alliances in Europe against nuclear weapons, against climate change, against poverty and to deal with our banks. Now, not everyone has the answers, but I say get the big decisions wrong and Britain's security and jobs are at risk. Get the big decisions right, and we can have a prosperous, fairer, greener and better Britain. Like me or not, I can deliver that plan. The way to do it is with a majority Labour government.  "

If you vote Conservative, you will get a new team running the country from May 7th. And you won't be stuck with what you've got now. But real change comes from your values, and there, there are big differences between us. I believe that we need to do more to help families. They are the absolute bedrock of a strong society. I want government to be accountable. I want less waste, less bureaucracy. Stopping the jobs tax, but making sure we have good public services that you get good value for money for. As we're going to discuss tonight, I want us to keep our defences strong, I want to keep our borders secure and our country safe. But real change, real change comes not just from politicians, but from when we all recognise that we have responsibilities. We're all in this together, and that's how we will build the big and strong society I believe we need in our country. "

We shouldn't be facing allegations of complicity in torture, we shouldn't have invaded Iraq. So I want us to lead in the world. I want us to lead in Europe, not complain from the sidelines. I want us to lead in creating a world free of nuclear weapons. And I want us to lead on the biggest challenge of all, climate change. My family knows what British values really mean.

I want us to be in Europe but not run by Europe. There will... you'll hear big differences between me and the other two parties. I don't want us to join the euro, I want I want us to keep the pound as our currency. I don't want us to give up the British rebate. I want to make sure we get value for money for what we put into Europe. I want to cut some of the bureaucracy, some of the rules, some of the regulations that I think drive business so mad. That's the agenda you'd get from a Conservative government in Europe. To those who say somehow this would be isolation, I say nonsense. President Sarkozy of France, he stands up for France in Europe. Angela Merkel in Germany, she stands up for Germany in Europe. I would do exactly the same for Europe.  "

What I learned when I was there was this: the European Union is not perfect - of course not. This is a club that took 15 years to define \"chocolate\" in a chocolate directive. Anything that takes 15 years to define chocolate is not a model of democratic efficiency. What I also learned was this, that there are a whole load of things, whether we like it or not, whatever your views on Europe and the european Union, which we simply can't do on our own. We can't deal with international crime that touches and affects every single community in this country on our own. We can't deal with climate change on our own. The weather doesn't stop at the cliffs of Dover. We can't regulate these wretched banks that got us into so much in the first place which now sprawl across countries.

Half our trade is with the European Union. 750,000 businesses - I'm sorry it's not your business, raising the question about the building trade - but 750,000 businesses trade with Europe. The idea that we should again be isolated and on the margins and not in the mainstream of Europe would be a terrible, terrible mistake. Now, I worked with the European leaders through the global financial crisis. I had to persuade them that we had to restructure our banks and they had to restructure their banks. I had to persuade them they had to work with America in the G20, but when Europe and America works together, we are so much stronger. Stronger to deal with climate change, which is one much my priorities, stronger to deal with the economy, stronger to deal with international crime, stronger to deal with terrorism, let us never again be an empty chair in Europe.

I think one of the reasons that people are so angry is that politicians at Westminster have given away powers to Brussels without asking us, the people, first. I think people felt particularly cheated when the European constitution came forward and we were told we were going to get a referendum and Gordon Brown and Labour stopped that from happening and Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats didn't vote with us to get that referendum. We should have had one. People feel cheated by that. As a result, one of the things I would do if I was your Prime Minister is straightaway pass a law through parliament that says if ever there's a future occasion when laws are being proposed to pass power from Westminster to Brussels, there will be a guarantee of a referendum held in our country. You send us to parliament to make decisions, make laws, discuss the issues, yes. You don't send us there to give away powers that belong to you. There should be a referendum guarantee if ever this happens again.  "

Look, we do need to have a referendum the next time there's a big transfer of powers to the European Union but it needs to be on the fundamental issue: do we stay in or do we go out? You have a right to make that choice in a referendum. I would argue we should stay in, not because it's perfect but because it's in our interests to do so. Let me give you, Christopher, a very concrete example. There was some time agoa operation by European police authorities which broke open a paedophile ring. They arrested 100 sex offenders, many of them in this country. And they released 20 young women from unimaginable abuse and servitude. something called Operation Koala. ou can Google it and look it up. Guess what? Conservative MEPs, UK Independence Party MEPs voted against the measures which made that possible. That is putting dogma above the safety of children. We are safer together, we're weaker apart.  "

That's what gives us paid holidays. He'd have to break up the European Union meeting and say, \"Look, 26 of you are against this, I'm the only one who's standign for this\". And what would happen? We are trying to get an economic recovery. That depends on economic recovery, depending on Germany, France and other countries growing as well.  Taking our exports. We have to get an agreement on climate change because of what happened at Copenhagen. Again, that would be postponed because we would be having a big argument as we did in the past with a Conservative government about repatriating powers in Britain. We've got other props we've got to deal with and these include security and terrorism. These are the issues. Let's look to the future.

That to me is the same old politics. Let me just ask this important point: this idea that somehow an in-out referendum is what the public wants I don't think is right, it's a con. What people want when a new treaty comes along, when a constitution comes along, is to have that choice to vote on that constitution. "

What would have been a con would be to have a referendum on one individual treaty, which, even if we'd had the referendum, and then we'd rejected the treaty, would have allowed, Christopher, the European Union to carry on exactly as before. Let's have the fundamental debate. I worked in my previous life before going into politics for a while as a negotiator on behalf of all of us, on behalf of Britain and the European Union, negotiating trade deals with the Chinese government, the Russian government and others. What I noticed there was that the Chinese and the Russians, they only listened to what we were saying because I was representing the largest single market in the world of 475 million consumers. Now, of course there are daft rules, of course it does daft things, but it seems to me that we punch above our weight when we stand together in Europe in a world, frankly, where you've got a lot of superpowers bumping up against each other and where, to coin a phrase, size does matter.

David's walked away from the European People's Party, which is an alliance of the centre, progressive parties in Europe, and gone in with a group of right-wing extremists. I want to work with the sensible people in Europe to get jobs for our British economy. If we don't trade with Europe, we lose jobs, we lose businesses, we lose growth.

Not to parachute democracy into Afghanistan, it's because we believe that if you allow Afghanistan to be a haven of extremism and terrorism, there will be more terrorist attacks here in Britain. So, from that principle, if we need to do that again, we should. The problem, of course, is we have done it in a manner where I don't think we've pursued the right strategy, we haven't given the right equipment to our troops. We haven't had proper international co-ordination on the ground in Afghanistan, we haven't worked properly with other countries in the region to do so. I think if you put soldiers into harm's way, you either do the job properly or you don't do it at all. If we ever take that decision again, let's make sure we've got the right equipment, the right strategy, so they can come back having done the job we've asked them to do, with their heads held high, knowing they have done the job well.

We are having to take action with our multilateral partners to deal with these problems, and will continue to have to do so. Why are we in Afghanistan, and why we have we got to be vigilant all the time? The reason is, there is a chain of terror that links these Al-Qaeda groups in different parts of the world to action that could happen in the United Kingdom. Every week I get a report, sometimes every day, of terrorist plots, most of which arise in the Afghanistan/Pakistan area, and we have got to deal with. To keep the streets safe in Britain, we have to take on Al-Qaeda wherever it is. I also have to say about Afghanistan that this is a mission that can work. The reason is, we are training up the Afghan soldiers and the Afghan police. So whenever we are in a mission abroad, we have to make sure that we have a means by which, in that country, they can build up their own security staff, so we can bring our troops home.

If you look at future operations like that, we have to learn from the mistakes of the past.

We have to think through not just what we are doing militarily, but actually is the aid there, are we helping these people? Do we have a political strategy for how we are going to get out of that country once we have tried to make it safe with our allies?

I personally think that we're not spending money on some of the right things. I wouldn't carry on spending money on the Eurofighter Typhoon, the third tranche of that Eurofighter project, consuming billions of pounds. I don't think it's right to do what both David Cameron and Gordon Brown want, which is now to commit, before we need to make a decision, to spend up to \u00a3100 billion renewing, exactly in the same old way, the Cold War Trident nuclear missile system.

We've got to be clear, that we cannot allow terrorists to have territory in the world that then they use as a base for attacking the United Kingdom.

I actually, to prepare for this debate, I went for a run this morning with someone who just got back from Afghanistan this morning, I couldn't keep up, he was someone who'd served for six months and had done an incredible job there. Just going back to the point about how we get these things right, one of the things that strikes you when you go to Afghanistan is that actually we are not getting things right politically. The south of the country is where Taliban grew, where they came from, that is the Pashtun part of the country. Yet when you see the Afghan National Army, it is dominated by people from the other parts of the country. There is a really big political issue there. We have to make sure the whole country in Afghanistan feels it's part of the Afghan Government. That's absolutely key for making sure we can bring our soldiers back home. Not just training the Afghan army and police, as Gordon said, vital though that is, we need a political settlement as well to help make sure we can come home.  "

Unless we can provide the necessary resources. I remember when I was in Helmand visiting the troops there, I talked to some mechanics, who look after the vehicles. They were telling me that they had been on a convoy previously which normally just takes one day to from one place to another, it took them a week, because every time the vehicle broke down in the sands there, they didn't have the necessary parts, they had to take parts from other vehicles. So, if we do this again, we cannot, cannot, cannot allow eight years to elapse, which is what's happened, until proper equipment is finally been provided to our very, very courageous servicemen and servicewomen. Look, we've had to change our tactics all the time because of what the Taliban has been doing. Originally, they wanted to win a face-to-face war with us, fighting person-to-person. Now they use explosive devices, these explosive devices are designed to scare as well as to maim our own troops. We have had to change our tactics and therefore bring in the explosive experts, bring in the metal detectors, bring in the drones to survey the land, make sure we have the proper intelligence, go into Pakistan and deal with the making of bombs as well. All these things have had to happen and we've had to change our tactics again because we want to train up the Afghan police and army so we're partnering with the Afghan police. I'd like to say to our troops, come back into the barracks and you will be safe. But I can't say that, because our strategy in Afghanistan depends on contact with the local people, persuading them they are safe with us, and safe in an Afghanistan free of the Taliban. We have had to change, yes, but it's response to the tactics of our opponents.  "

In fact, we found, far better, even in this area where there's not much sun is a solar panel.

But I don't do enough. I'm acutely aware I don't do enough, I'm like many, many people, I wish I could and would do more. Part of the problem, because you referred specifically, Nicola, to aeroplanes, and you're quite right that flights at least when they are able to fly, and there isn't too much volcanic ash around, do create a growing proportion of the CO2 emissions, so we need to tackle it. I think what is irrational is the moment you have a tax system which taxes passengers in aeroplanes, that means that planes with freight in them, for instance, aren't taxed, to reflect the pollution they cause. You've got lots of planes that are half empty or barely got any passengers at all.

It takes a long, long, long time to build these nuclear plants. All the experts agree that it would take well into the next decade to create new nuclear energy, which would be too late to deal with the energy problems we have now. For a fraction of the money that I think both David Cameron and Gordon Brown want to spend on subsidising the nuclear industry, we could develop mass insulation programmes of our homes, our schools and our hospitals. Remember, 27% of all carbon dioxide emissions in this country go straight out of your window, through the roof of your house.

They're in the business of helping insulation and giving people advice about the use of energy. So we're trying to do this at the moment and we will do more in future years. Yes, we've got to insulate our houses, yes, we've got to have carbon-free homes where possible, yes, we've got to have the electric car, we're investing in that, the hybrid car, and yes, we've got to develop offshore wind power.

I don't agree with him about homosexuality, and I think the Catholic Church has got some very, very serious work to do to unearth and come to terms with some of the appalling things that have happened, and they need to do that. But I do think we should respect people of faith. I think faith is important in our country. I think faith-based organisations, whether they are Christian or Jewish, or Muslim, or Hindu, do amazing things in our country, whether it is working in our prisons or providing good schools or actually helping some of the most vulnerable people in our country. A country where faith is welcome, yes, a visit from the Pope, yes, but does that mean we have to agree with everything he says? No.  "

And I think many Catholics themselves feel really extremely, extremely torn apart by what's happened. I think they do want to see the Catholic Church express greater openness and repentance. You can't keep a lid on sin, and of course you need to move with the times. I do welcome the Pope's visit, but I hope by the time he does visit, there is a greater recognition that there has been terrible, terrible suffering, there have been abusive relationships which have left immeasurable scars on individual people's lives and we need a process of openness and then healing. You can't undo the tragedies of the past, but you can be open about them so people can start to move on.  "

And no matter what you can try to do to help, there is always this problem that they have to face up to every day, that they were abused, cruelly abused, by people in whom they placed their faith and trust. So the church has got to deal with these problems, and it's got to make sure that there is an open and clean confession about what has happened, and that we help those people who have been put into difficulty by this abuse. You know, I welcome the Pope's visit to Britain. And I want him to come to Britain for two reasons: one is the Catholic Church is a great part of our society, and we should recognise it as such, and I hope every British citizen wants to see this visit by the Pope take place. Secondly, we must break down the barriers of religion that exist in our world. The faiths must come together and recognise they have common values and common interests. They all believe that we should be good neighbours to each other. I'm from the Presbyterian religion, but I support the visit, but I not only support it, I want religious faiths to work more closely together.  "

On human embryology, I've disagreed with the Catholic Church because I believe if you can treat a disease by using embryos that are enabling us to make sure people can be free of some of the conditions that afflict their lives, we should do so under the right rules. I'm sorry that in principle there is a disagreement with the church on that. On the question of contraception, I think we know that in Africa, we know round the world, that it is important to give women access and choice so that they can make their own decisions, and I regret the fact that the Catholic Church does not do that.

They now say, which is good, say they do welcome that. You're the boss, you're the boss. The other thing of course we need to do is clean up all the murky business of party funding. We've all had problems with party funding. Again, there was a deal, there was a deal on the table, we supported it, to clean up party funding. Yet again, the old parties said no. Gordon Brown wanted to protect his trade union pay masters, David Cameron wanted to protect his paymaster in Belize. I think we all agree on the rhetoric of cleaning up politics, but we actually have to act. I'd say one final thing: one of the reasons why your friends and your neighbours are perhaps right in saying they feel ignored is because we have this very odd electoral system which allows Gordon Brown the Prime Minister to be in power when only 22% of people voted for his party last time, many people are being ignored and we need to change that as well.

People say, \"I pay my taxes to have decent politics and yet the money's been spent on all these appalling things.\" They want to be to be absolutely sure this is never ever going to happen again. So strict limits on what can be spent, total transparency so you, the voters, can see every penny. That I think is the absolutely first thing that needs to be done.

Something which I'm sure you're familiar with, which is there are so many other costs which the elderly have to confront, which really do make it extremely difficult to make ends meet. Fuel costs. We have just had a very cold winter for example, it's a very good example. I got a letter a few months ago from an elderly couple, who said to me they now found it so difficult to heat their homes on cold winter days, that on those cold winter days, they get into a bus in their town and travel around the bus just to stay warm. That is wrong. It is wrong that energy companies charge you more for the first bits of energy that you use in your home than the later bits.

That's how bad it is. I think we need to, therefore, make sure that we use what little money we've got, money is tight at the moment, wisely. And what we are saying is this. The winter fuel payments, the age of eligibility is going to rise, this is a decision which Gordon Brown's Government has already taken, from 60 to 65 in the coming years. We're saying if you bring that forward you could use the money to actually extend the winter fuel payments to people who are terminally ill and disabled, who at the moment don't get access to the winter fuel payments. I think that is fair. One final thing. We talked about social care, we talked about this last week, I really cannot stress enough, I think that's one issue where we just have got to put people before politics for once. This is something which is such a big issue, we need to agree on a common approach, that is the only way to provide good social care. "

In the next parliament, what we're proposing to do is put a two-year limit on payments, so if you're, for example, suffering from Alzheimer's or other diseases and you have to be in an old people's home for a longer period of time, can't be in your own home, we will suspend any payments after two years for personal and medical care.

We have got a proposal which will take the money which the government has allocated to its rather flawed bill on social care and use it instead to say to those who provide a lot of care every week, here's money so you can take a week off, spend some time with yourself on holiday just getting a break.

It is better if politicians, I know it's an unfashionable thing to say, but it's better if politicians try and work together. That's why I proposed several weeks ago, that irrespective of the outcome of the next election, why don't we set up something which I call a council for financial stability, and you'd gather in that council for financial stability the Chancellor and the Shadow Chancellors, the Governor of the Bank of England, the Head of the Financial Services Authority to do one simple thing, which is to come clean with you about how big this black hole is because there's still dispute about exactly how bad it is and then have an agreement on roughly how long it will take to fill it.

And I'm afraid that we don't have agreement on what needs to be done even this year to sort the economy out. I want to see our economy grow this year. I want to see unemployment come down. I want to see businesses thrive, and that means we've got to keep the government support in the economy for the time being, something the Conservatives don't want to do.

But there is a problem in that you do need to have agreement. There is a fundamental disagreement between me and the other two parties about what we do this year. I think we badly need to roll up our sleeves and make some savings this year so we can stop the jobs tax, the national National Insurance tax rise, that is coming down the road. When you've got an economy that is trying to recover, the worst thing you can do is put tax on every single job in our country. That's why it's over 1,100 business leaders have said don't do this.

I will continue to ask people to give their talents to public service, and that is something that is really important to do. But there is this fundamental position about this year. I think we've got to resolve this. I have had to take the economy through the most global financial crisis. We made the right decisions to take ownership of the banks, and the right decisions to get the world together to deal with that recession. Every time, we've said we have to support the economy through difficult times. Now, what David is saying even when it is fragile, he wants, for ideological reasons I think, to take \u00a36 billion out of the economy.

To go back to Frank's question, I do have one specific proposal where we really think we should come together much more effectively. That is, I want to see the National Security Council sitting as a war cabinet from day one if I become Prime Minister. Because, day one, Afghanistan is the top priority, getting it right. I would invite, as Prime Minister, the leaders of the other two main parties to come to that meeting several times a year to make sure they were really seeing the advice we were getting from the security services, from the generals, from the Chiefs of Staff.

And thirdly, we have to do something about the legacy about the problem created by the chaos which Labour and Conservative governments created in our immigration system. That was lots of people coming here illegally, who are now still living, years and years and years, in the shadows of our economy. I'd rather get them out of the hands of criminal gangs, so we can go after the criminal gangs, into the hands of the taxman, if they want to play by the rules, pay their taxes, speak English.

We have a points system to do so. No unskilled worker from outside Europe can now come into our country. If you have a skill, then we will get a British person to do that job advertised in a Jobcentre if the skill is available in Britain. We are gradually reducing the number of skills we need to come from abroad. So cooks and care assistants in future, they will come from abroad, they're trained up in Britain.

You can wish away, if either of you wish, that there are people who have been living here for a long time in the shadows of our economy.

Biometric visas mean that we can stop people at airports even before they come into the country if they've not got the right identification. So we're tightening up on that.

Don't live in denial about the fact that, because of the chaos in the system, we've got lots of people here who are working for criminal gangs rather than for Britain. We've got to deal with that. You can pretend we can wish it away. It is a problem. They are here. Now, of course what I'm saying is controversial and people will try and score points. It is at least an attempt to deal with an issue which we have to deal with. I don't think we can have another ten years, another 20 years in the old way, just ignoring these things. We can't come up with promises like caps, which don't work. And by the way...  "

It is a sensitive issue, and it needs to be dealt with sensitively and reasonably. It's very important that we talk about this properly.

And what it would really achieve is getting back to where we used to be, where we didn't have immigration questions at public meetings, we weren't asked about it on the streets. When you knocked on a door, nobody raised it. Why? Because the British public was happy with the level of immigration. We knew that was a level we could integrate and provide good health, housing and schools for people. It's been out of control these last 13 years. That's Labour's fault. And from all I can hear, the Liberal Democrats would make it much, much worse. "

The fact is, every year, you need to talk with the health authorities, the housing authorities, the education authorities, and business, and set a cap to achieve a very big reduction in overall immigration levels. That can be done, we've done it in our past, we can do it again in our future. What's required is political will from a party that's prepared to make the difference.  "

You're proposing to give people an assurance that we're going to count people in and count people out, but you don't know how many people. All I'm saying on the immigration debate, it's difficult, none of us have got perfect answers. But let's at least not pretend that you can put forward these ideas which have got no substance, haven't been thought through. At least the kind of ideas I've been putting through are trying to deal with a really, really difficult issue which has been brushed under the carpet for too long.  "

You can't come in unless you've got a skill to offer, if you're from outside the European Union. That has meant there are no unskilled workers coming into this country, a reduction in skilled workers, a reduction in university students as well. That is what we are actually doing now. We're counting people in and out from the end of the year.  "

Since 1997, since Labour came to power, it has never been lower than 140,000, sometimes it has been 200,000, that's equivalent to two million across a decade.

We've talked this evening about Afghanistan and the responsibility I take, every day, making sure our forces can do the job in Afghanistan, and can soon, as a result of the efforts we are making, bring our forces home. We've talked today also about security, and how we need to be part of multilateral disarmament negotiations, so that we, Britain, do not give up our weapons, unless others are prepared to do so, and reduce their weapons as well. We have talked also about the economy this evening, I've heard a number of people ask questions about the deficit, ask questions about how the economy is going to fare as businesses in the future, whether in or out of Europe. The issue for me is don't do anything that puts this economic recovery at risk. We have fought so hard, for so long, over these last two years, to make sure we get through what has been the worst global financial recession since the 1930s. We've had to take ownership of our banks, we've had call the world together in London to have a big summit so that we can make decisions that everybody will work together. We all decided we'd put resources into the economy. Unfortunately, the Conservatives want to take these resources out far too early and put thousands of jobs at risk. I would say this evening, David, you're a risk to the economy. Nick, you're a risk because of what you're saying on Iran and on nuclear weapons to our security. Nick, you would leave us weak. David, you would leave us isolated in Europe.  I think these are the problems that these parties have got to face up to. We have a credible long-term plan for the future of Britain. "

To have new leadership, to take the country forward, to solve the problems that we have. I think the Conservatives are best-placed to offer that. If you vote Conservative, you know you can get fresh, new leadership, from a new team on May 7th, rather than being stuck with what we have now. You've heard in the debate today some big differences set out between us, about how we believe you have to give more priority to keeping our country safe, keeping our borders secure, making sure we keep our defences strong. But also you've heard a lot of differences on values, how the family comes first for me, how we need to do more to help those who actually do the right thing and want their Government behind them. We do face some difficult times in this country, but I still think we have incredible days ahead of us. We're a great country in so many different ways, with the right leadership, with the right values, with a clean break from these 13 years of failure, we can achieve anything if we pull together and build the big society we all know we need to make our country a better place to live in.

We can lead, we can shape the world around us, not complain about the world around us. We have talked about a number of things this evening. We've talked about Europe, Afghanistan, climate change, the Pope. We've talked about things closer to home as well, immigration, MPs' expenses, pensions. I believe, on all those things, all those issues, we can act differently. There's still some way to go before this election is decided, but I hope that whether you're going to vote in the next few days by post, or make up your mind in the ballot box on May 6th, you agree with me that something really exciting is beginning to happen. People are beginning to believe, beginning to hope that we can do something different this time. Of course there are people who will try to block change, of course there are people who are spreading fear to stop the change you want. I think they're wrong. I think if we do things differently, if we stand up for the value's that have made our country great, then we can be proud again, proud of greater fairness here at home, and proud also, of standing up for the things we believe in, in the world. We don't simply need to choose from the old choices of the past, we don't need to repeat the mistakes of the past. Don't let anyone tell you this time it can't be different. It can. "
